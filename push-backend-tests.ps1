feat: Add comprehensive backend testing suite

- Add 42+ unit and integration tests for backend API
- Implement proper mocking strategy (HttpContext, Session, ILogger)
- Add AuthController tests with session management validation
- Add WeatherForecastController tests with mocked dependencies
- Add WeatherForecast model tests for business logic
- Add integration tests with TestServer and in-memory database
- Create test utilities and base classes for reusability
- Add test runner scripts (batch and PowerShell)
- Update README with comprehensive testing documentation
- Include detailed testing README in test project

Test Coverage:
- AuthController: 8 tests (login validation, edge cases)
- WeatherForecastController: 10 tests (data structure, mocking)
- WeatherForecast Model: 12 tests (temperature conversion logic)
- Integration Tests: 12 tests (end-to-end HTTP testing)

Technologies: xUnit, Moq, FluentAssertions, ASP.NET Core Testing
